command: astra db cqlsh exec two_regions_db -e 'DESC CARS' -o json
exit_code: 0
comments: 
 | Can't really test human output since we don't capture cqlsh output for human outputs
 | But at least we can verify the command runs and the exit code is correct
 | (human output returns cqlsh exit code; non-human output returns the cqlsh exit code via a field)
