comments: 
 | Can't really test human output since we don't capture cqlsh output for human outputs
 | But at least we can verify the command runs and the exit code is correct
 | (human output returns cqlsh exit code; non-human output returns the cqlsh exit code via a field)
---- output ----
stderr: [INFO] Reading CQL statements from stdin...
stderr: [INFO] Use backslashes for multi-line statements
