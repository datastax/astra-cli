command: astra db cqlsh exec two_regions_db 'DESC CARS'
exit_code: 1
comments: 
 | Can't really test human output since we don't capture cqlsh output for human outputs
 | But at least we can verify the command runs and the exit code is correct
 | (human output returns cqlsh exit code; non-human output returns the cqlsh exit code via a field)
---- output ----
stderr: [WARNING] Providing the CQL statement as a positional parameter is deprecated and will be removed in future versions.
stderr: [WARNING] Please use the 'astra db cqlsh exec -e "CQL STATEMENT"' syntax instead.
