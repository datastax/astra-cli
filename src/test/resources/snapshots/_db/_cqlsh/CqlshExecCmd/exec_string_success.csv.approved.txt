exit_code: 0
comments: 
 | Can't really test human output since we don't capture cqlsh output for human outputs
 | But at least we can verify the command runs and the exit code is correct
 | (human output returns cqlsh exit code; non-human output returns the cqlsh exit code via a field)
---- output ----
stdout: code,message,exit_code,stdout,stderr
stdout: OK,"Cqlsh executed with exit code 0, with 1 lines in stdout and 0 lines in stderr.",0,Current consistency level is LOCAL_QUORUM.,
