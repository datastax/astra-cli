exit_code: 0
comments: 
 | Can't really test human output since we don't capture cqlsh output for human outputs
 | But at least we can verify the command runs and the exit code is correct
 | (human output returns cqlsh exit code; non-human output returns the cqlsh exit code via a field)

stdout: code,message,exitCode,stdout,stderr
stdout: OK,"Cqlsh executed with exit code 2, with 1 lines in stdout and 1 lines in stderr.",2,,<stdin>:1:'cars' not found in keyspaces
